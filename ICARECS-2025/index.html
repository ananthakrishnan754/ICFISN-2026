            <h2>About ICFISN 2025</h2>
            <p>The International Conference on Fostering Innovation in intelligent System and Next-gen Networks (ICFISN 2025) aims to serve as a pivotal platform for the convergence of disciplines within electrical, electronics, and computer engineering. This year's focal theme, "Sustainable Approaches in Electrical, Electronics, and Computer Engineering by Integrating AI for Future Innovations," underscores the critical necessity for interdisciplinary collaboration in addressing the complex challenges of our rapidly evolving technological landscape.</p>
            <p>At the heart of this conference is the commitment to fostering the development of environmentally conscious and resource-efficient technologies. Participants will explore cutting-edge research and innovations that emphasize sustainability in engineering practices. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) is positioned as a transformative catalyst, propelling the industry towards optimizing processes and enhancing the functionality of smart systems. By harnessing the capabilities of AI, we can not only improve operational efficiencies but also devise intelligent solutions that significantly reduce energy consumption and minimize environmental impact.</p>
            <p>ICFISN 2025 invites researchers, practitioners, and industry leaders to present forward-thinking studies that investigate the synergies between AI and sustainable engineering. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Smart Grid Technologies:</strong> Innovations in electrical grids that utilize AI for real-time data analysis, predictive maintenance, and enhanced energy management.</li>
                <li><strong>Energy-Efficient Electronics:</strong> Development of low-power circuits and systems that leverage AI for optimized performance and reduced carbon footprint.</li>
                <li><strong>Sustainable Computing:</strong> Exploration of green computing practices and the role of AI in optimizing resource allocation and minimizing waste in data centers.</li>
                <li><strong>IoT and Smart Systems:</strong> The integration of AI in the Internet of Things (IoT) for creating sustainable smart cities, encompassing transportation, energy management, and urban planning.</li>
                <li><strong>Machine Learning for Environmental Monitoring:</strong> Utilizing AI algorithms to analyze environmental data and support sustainable practices across Industries.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The conference will feature keynote speeches from distinguished thought leaders, interactive workshops, and panel discussions that encourage a rich exchange of ideas. By fostering collaboration among academia, industry, and governmental organizations, ICFISN 2025 aims to catalyze innovations that are not only technologically advanced but also environmentally sustainable. As we look to the future, it is imperative that we prioritize the development of integrated solutions that reflect our commitment to sustainability. Join us at ICFISN 2025 to engage with pioneering research that positions AI as a cornerstone for advancements in electrical, electronics, and computer engineering, driving us towards a more sustainable and innovative future.</p>

            <h2>About the Institution</h2>
            <p>Sree Buddha College of Engineering Pattoor is established in the year 2002 (Now Autonomous from the academic year 2024-25) by the Sree Buddha Educational Society Kollam which is registered under the Travancore-Cochin literacy, Scientific and Charitable Societies Act, 1955. Under the leadership of Prof. K. Sasikumar, a group of educationalists envisaged the emergence of an engineering college on the bank of Karingalipuncha in the rural area of Nooranad, the birds village of Kerala to promote weaker section of society by providing quality education at global standards. The college which began its stride with three B.Tech programs in 2002, now offers B.Tech/M.Tech/PhD programs in nine branches of engineering and Technology. The college is affiliated to APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University and is approved by the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), New Delhi. The college offers NBA accredited B.Tech programs and is Reaccredited by NAAC for another five years since November 2019. The college is also recognised under Section 2(f) of the UGC act 1956. In recent years the college has organized many programs of national importance, Prime Ministers Samsad Gramin Yojana (PM-SAGY), Smart India Hackathon (2019), National Conference Series on Engineering Education for Facing the Future (E2F2) since 2017, IIT Bombay Remote Center based courses for engineering college teachers, etc. The college provides value based education and strives to develop the overall personality of students by enhancing creativity, self confidence, communication and leadership skills. The college has become a center of excellence catering to the needs of higher education sector in the State of Kerala.</p>
